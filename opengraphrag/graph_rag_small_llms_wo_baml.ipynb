       " GraphDocument(nodes=[], relationships=[], source=Document(metadata={}, page_content='Epic’s latest tool can animate hyperrealistic MetaHumans with an iPhone Today, Epic is releasing a new tool designed to capture an actor’s facial performance using a device as simple as an iPhone and apply it to a hyperrealistic “MetaHuman” in the Unreal Engine in “minutes.” The feature, dubbed MetaHuman Animator, was detailed at the Game Developers Conference in March but is now available for developers to try out for themselves. Epic has also released a new video today produced by one of its internal teams to show what the tool is capable of.\\nWhile Epic’s short film shows off some impressively subtle facial animation, the big benefit the company is emphasizing is the speed with which MetaHuman Animator produces results. “The animation is produced locally using GPU hardware, with the final animation available in minutes,” the company’s press release reads. That has the potential to not just save a studio money by making performance capture more efficient but also, Epic argues, it could allow them to experiment and be more creative.\\n“Need an actor to give you more, dig into a different emotion, or simply explore a new direction?” Epic’s press release asks. “Have them do another take. You’ll be able to review the results in about the time it takes to make a cup of coffee.” Facial animation can be applied to a MetaHuman character “in just a few clicks,” Epic says, and the system is even smart enough to animate a character’s tongue based on the performance’s audio.\\nPerformance capture using iPhones has been possible in the Unreal Engine since at least 2020 with the launch of Epic’s Live Link Face iOS app, but now, it’s combined with the high level of detail promised by Epic’s MetaHuman technology. As well as working on the iPhone 12 and up (which is capable of capturing both video and depth data), Epic says MetaHuman Animator can also be used with “existing vertical stereo head-mounted camera [systems] to achieve even greater fidelity.”\\nEpic says the Blue Dot short film released today should give some idea of what its animation tool is capable of. It was produced by Epic Games’ 3Lateral team and stars actor Radivoje Bukvić delivering a monologue based on a poem by Mika Antić. Although Epic says it’s possible to tweak animation post-capture, it claims “minimal interventions” were made on top of the MetaHuman Animator’s performance capture to achieve these results.\\nIf you want to learn more, Epic has released an instructional video on how to use the tool. Documentation is also available via the MetaHuman hub on the Epic Developer Community.')),\n",

The new smartphone has a design similar to its Vivo X90 series siblings — Vivo X90 and Vivo X90 Pro. The Vivo X90s is shown to have a Zeiss-tuned triple rear camera unit. The upcoming model is expected to retain the key specification of the Vivo X90. Meanwhile, Chinese tipsters have leaked the specifications of the upcoming handset. The Vivo X90s is said to run on MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC and could be offered in four different colour options.\\nJia Jingdong posted an image of the Vivo X90s on the Chinese microblogging platform providing us a glimpse of the design from the rear. The render shows the handset in a white finish with rounded corners. The image suggests Zeiss branded triple rear cameras on the rear panel along with an LED flash. It seems to have a glass back with the Vivo branding at the bottom.\\nVivo, however, didn't confirm the exact launch date or key specifications of the Vivo X90s.\\nSeparately, several Chinese tipsters posted specifications of the upcoming Vivo X90s on Weibo. According to the tipsters, the handset will be powered by the latest MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. This would be an upgrade over the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 SoC found on the vanilla Vivo X90. The new model is said to offer Wi-Fi 7 connectivity and could be offered in black, blue, green, red, and white colour options. The Vivo X90, in contrast, has Wi-Fi 6 and is available in China Red, Ice Blue, and Original Black (translated from Chinese) in China.\\nA TENAA listing from May revealed the specifications of the Vivo X90s. As per the listing, it will have a 6.78-inch 1.5K (1,280 x 2,800 pixels) curved AMOLED display. The screen has a centre-aligned hole-punch cutout at the top. It is listed to carry up to 16GB of RAM along with up to 1TB of inbuilt storage.\\nOppo, OnePlus, Realme to Operate as Separate Entities in India: Report\\nThe triple rear camera setup of the handset could include a 50-megapixel main camera sensor, accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens, and a 12-megapixel portrait sensor. It is said to pack a 32-megapixel selfie camera as well. Vivo is expected to provide a 4,690mAh battery on the Vivo X90s.\\nThe Vivo X90 Pro has finally made its debut in India, but is the company's flagship smartphone for 2023 equipped with enough upgrades over its predecessor?

With this order, GE recorded more than 3 GW of orders in India with its 2.7 MW turbine and anticipates crossing 5 GW of onshore wind installed base in the country by early 2024.” the company said.\\nAmplus Solar’s wind farm will be commissioned by August 2024 and will provide accessible, affordable, and reliable green energy to local businesses and consumers, it added.\\nDeepak Maloo, Regional Sales Leader for GE Vernova’s onshore wind business in Asia Pacific said, “GE has demonstrated expertise in India, having installed over 50 per cent of new wind capacity in the country last year. We are thankful to Amplus Solar for entrusting us with their first wind farm and look forward to furthering our partnership as the company continues to build its renewable energy portfolio under the leadership of Petronas.”\\nAmplus Solar CEO, Sharad Pungalia, said, “We are happy to have found an experienced partner GE Vernova as we take another step in contributing to the country’s net-zero targets with our first wind-power project. We are confident that together, we can create the synergies needed for the successful completion of this project.”\\nGE Vernova’s 2.7-132 wind turbine has proven to be the technology of choice for many customers in India due to its industry leading performance at India’s low wind speeds.\\nThe project will leverage GE’s significant local footprint in India with product design primarily at GE’s technology centre in Bengaluru, turbines assembled at GE’s manufacturing facility in Pune and blades manufactured at LM Wind Power’s plant in Vadodara.'))]"

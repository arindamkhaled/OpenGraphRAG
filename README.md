# GraphRAG with Open-Source LLMs, BAML, Neo4j, and Embeddings

**GraphRAG with Open-Source LLMs, BAML, Neo4j, and Embeddings** is a project that implements a Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using open-source large language models (LLMs), Neo4j, and an open-source embedding model. Inspired by Neo4j's blog on graph RAGs, this project expands support to small, open-source LLMs, making it accessible and customizable for a wider range of applications. Function-calling with BAML and open-source embedding models are used to enhance flexibility and performance in LLM-driven graph queries and retrieval.

## Key Features

- **Graph-based RAG**: Uses Neo4j for structured data representation and relationship-driven retrieval.
- **Open-Source LLMs**: Supports lightweight LLMs suited for diverse deployment environments.
- **Open-Source Embeddings**: Demonstrates how to integrate an open-source embedder to enhance semantic search and retrieval quality.
- **Function Calling with BAML**: Allows advanced handling of model responses and enriched functionality.

This project is ideal for developers looking to integrate graph databases with open-source LLMs and embedders for improved contextual responses and dynamic information retrieval.
